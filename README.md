# Multi-Label-Image-Classification

## Introduction
The goal of this challenge is to recognize objects from a number of visual object classes in realistic scenes (i.e. not pre-segmented objects). It is fundamentally a supervised learning learning problem in that a training set of labelled images is provided. The twenty object classes that have been selected are: 
 
Person: person 
Animal: bird, cat, cow, dog, horse, sheep 
Vehicle: aeroplane, bicycle, boat, bus, car, motorbike, train 
Indoor: bottle, chair, dining table, potted plant, sofa, tv/monitor 

For this task, we will use the dataset from Pascal VOC challenge 2007. Download the dataset from http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/ 
[Look at the Development Kit section for training data and Test Data section for test data]


## The task
Our task is to identify the classes present in a particular image. We will use three types of models for this task 

a.	Train twenty different neural networks. Each neural network detects a separate class, i.e, one neural network detects car, another one detects aeroplane, etc. 

b.	Using a shared neural network as a featuriser. Then connect it to task specific layers. For each task, there should be a single neuron in its task specific output layer. As discussed before, the architecture is similar to the following image: 
 
c.	Using a single neural network with twenty neurons in output layer. The architecture is also discussed while covering multi-task learning. 


## Points to be noted 
1.  The output for each image should be a vector of size 20. Each position representing a separate class, 0 denoting its absence and 1 denoting its presence. 
2.	Read the actual vector from the given annotation files. 
3.	Report average cosine similarity of actual vectors and output vectors. (For Test Data. Donâ€™t use any of the test data for training) 
4.	Include some visual outputs in your report. (Some images and their actual annotations vs your output annotations; By annotations, I mean the classes that are present)  
5.	Include your remarks on which model is performing better and why.
